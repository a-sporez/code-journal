# Order Of Operations

A common way to remember the order is the acronym **PEMDAS** (sometimes pronounced "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"), which stands for:

1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

Let’s break down each part:

### 1. **Parentheses** (P):
Evaluate expressions inside parentheses (or other grouping symbols like brackets or braces) first. If there are nested parentheses, work from the innermost set outward.

Example:  
\[
5 \times (2 + 3) = 5 \times 5 = 25
\]
In this case, you first evaluate \(2 + 3\) inside the parentheses.

### 2. **Exponents** (E):
Next, evaluate any exponents or powers. This includes square roots, cubes, etc.

Example:  
\[
2^3 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13
\]
Here, \(2^3\) is evaluated first (since it’s an exponent) before adding 5.

### 3. **Multiplication and Division** (MD):
After parentheses and exponents, perform multiplication and division as they appear from **left to right** in the expression. These operations are treated with equal priority, so you go in the order they are written, not necessarily doing multiplication before division.

Example:  
\[
12 \div 4 \times 3 = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]
You divide first, then multiply. Even though PEMDAS lists multiplication before division, the left-to-right rule applies here.

### 4. **Addition and Subtraction** (AS):
Finally, perform addition and subtraction as they appear from **left to right** in the expression. Just like with multiplication and division, addition and subtraction are treated equally in terms of priority, and you work from left to right.

Example:  
\[
10 - 3 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
\]
You subtract first, then add.

### Full Example Using PEMDAS:
Let's apply the order of operations to a more complex expression:
\[
8 + 3 \times (2^2) - 9 \div 3
\]

1. **Parentheses first**:  
   Inside the parentheses is \(2^2\), so we calculate that:
   \[
   2^2 = 4
   \]
   Now, the expression is:
   \[
   8 + 3 \times 4 - 9 \div 3
   \]

2. **Exponents**: Already done inside the parentheses.

3. **Multiplication and Division** (left to right):  
   First, \(3 \times 4 = 12\):
   \[
   8 + 12 - 9 \div 3
   \]
   Then, \(9 \div 3 = 3\):
   \[
   8 + 12 - 3
   \]

4. **Addition and Subtraction** (left to right):  
   First, \(8 + 12 = 20\):
   \[
   20 - 3
   \]
   Then, \(20 - 3 = 17\).

So, the final answer is 17.

### Important Notes:
- Operations inside grouping symbols like parentheses always come first.
- Multiplication and division are done in the order they appear from left to right. The same goes for addition and subtraction.
- Be careful not to apply the order incorrectly, such as always doing multiplication before division or addition before subtraction.

# Common Factors

The question seems to be asking for the factorization of the algebraic expression:

\[
35ab + 14ca + 28da
\]

To "factor" an expression means to rewrite it as a product of its simplest components. In this case, you need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms and factor that out.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Look for common factors in the coefficients**:  
   - The numbers are 35, 14, and 28. The greatest common factor of these numbers is 7.

2. **Look for common variables**:  
   - The variables are \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). Each term has \(a\) in common.

So, we can factor out \(7a\) from the entire expression:

\[
35ab + 14ca + 28da = 7a(5b + 2c + 4d)
\]

Thus, the expression factored is:

\[
7a(5b + 2c + 4d)
\]
