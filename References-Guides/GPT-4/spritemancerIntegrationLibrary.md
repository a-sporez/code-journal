# Spritemancer integration

If you have **Spritemancer** from Steam, here’s how to set it up for your Love2D project. The process involves locating the Spritemancer files within your Steam installation and ensuring they are properly included in your Love2D project.

### Step 1: Locate Spritemancer Files

1. **Open Steam**:
   - Launch the Steam client on your computer.

2. **Navigate to Your Library**:
   - Go to your **Library** and find **Spritemancer** in your list of games.

3. **Find Installation Directory**:
   - Right-click on **Spritemancer** in your library and select **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Local Files** tab and click on **Browse Local Files**. This will open the installation folder for Spritemancer.

### Step 2: Copy Spritemancer Files

1. **Identify Necessary Files**:
   - In the installation directory, look for files related to Spritemancer, such as:
     - `spritemancer.lua`
     - Any other relevant files or folders (e.g., libraries, examples).

2. **Copy the Files**:
   - Copy the necessary Spritemancer files to your Love2D project directory. You can create a subdirectory named `Spritemancer` in your project for organization.
   - Your project structure should look something like this:
     ```
     MyLove2DProject/
     ├── main.lua
     ├── src/
     ├── Spritemancer/      (This folder contains the Spritemancer files)
     ```

### Step 3: Use Spritemancer in Your Love2D Project

1. **Require the Spritemancer Library**:
   - Open your `main.lua` file (or any Lua file where you want to use Spritemancer).
   - Require the Spritemancer library:
     ```lua
     local spritemancer = require("Spritemancer.spritemancer")
     ```

2. **Load Sprites**:
   - Use the following in your `love.load()` function to load your sprites:
     ```lua
     function love.load()
         local sprite = spritemancer.loadSprite("path/to/your/sprite") -- Replace with your actual sprite path
     end
     ```

### Step 4: Exporting Sprites from Spritemancer

1. **Create or Open Your Sprite Sheet in Spritemancer**:
   - Use the Spritemancer application to create and set up your sprite sheet.
   - Configure your animations and frames.

2. **Export the Sprite Sheet**:
   - After creating your sprite, export it as a `.png` image and a `.json` or `.lua` file. 
   - Save these files in your Love2D project directory (e.g., in a `sprites/` folder).

3. **Load the Sprite Sheet**:
   - Load the exported sprites in your project:
     ```lua
     local sprite = spritemancer.loadSprite("sprites/mySpriteSheet") -- Adjust the path as needed
     ```

### Step 5: Testing Your Setup

1. **Run Your Love2D Project**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run:
     ```bash
     love .
     ```

2. **Check for Errors**:
   - Look for any error messages in the console that may indicate issues with loading Spritemancer or the sprite files.

### Step 6: Troubleshooting

- **File Paths**: Ensure that your sprite file paths are correct relative to your project directory.
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all necessary Spritemancer files are included in your project.
- **Error Messages**: If you encounter errors, they will often indicate which file or line of code is problematic.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate Spritemancer into your Love2D project using the files from your Steam installation. This setup allows you to create and manage sprites effectively within your game. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

To perform the conversion from SCML to Lua using the `scml2lua.py` script, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Python Installed**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Download or Access the `scml2lua.py` Script**: If you don't have the script already, you can find it through repositories or forums dedicated to the specific tool or project you're working on. You might find the script on GitHub or similar platforms.

3. **Open Your Command Line Interface**: Use the Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (macOS/Linux), or any other command line interface you prefer.

4. **Run the Conversion Command**: Navigate to the directory containing your `.SCML` file and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python scml2lua.py your_file.SCML > your_file.SCML.lua
   ```

   This command will execute the Python script, taking `your_file.SCML` as input and redirecting the output to `your_file.SCML.lua`.

If you're looking for specific versions or sources for `scml2lua.py`, consider checking platforms like GitHub where developers may have shared the script or similar utilities. Here are a couple of potential sources to explore:

- **GitHub Repositories**: Search for repositories that focus on `SCML` or similar file types. You might find projects that already include the `scml2lua.py` script or a similar tool.
- **Coding Communities**: Websites like Stack Overflow or specialized forums might have users who have shared their own scripts or modifications for this type of conversion.

If you have more specific needs or a particular project context, feel free to share!

To automate the conversion of SCML files to Lua in your Love2D project, you can create a script that integrates the conversion process. Here's a step-by-step approach to how you might implement this:

### 1. **Setting Up the Project**

Ensure you have a basic Love2D project structure in place. You should have a `main.lua` file where you can implement your conversion logic.

### 2. **Using Lua's Built-in Functionality**

You can utilize Lua’s file handling capabilities to read the SCML file and parse its contents. Since SCML files are structured in XML, you may want to use a library like **LuaXML** or **Lustache** to parse the XML content.

### 3. **Creating the Conversion Logic**

Here's a basic outline of how you can set up your script:

```lua
-- main.lua
local xml = require("LuaXML") -- Ensure you've included LuaXML in your project

-- Function to read an SCML file
local function readSCML(file)
    local fileHandle = io.open(file, "r")
    local content = fileHandle:read("*all")
    fileHandle:close()
    return content
end

-- Function to convert SCML to Lua (placeholder logic)
local function convertSCMLToLua(scmlContent)
    local parsedXML = xml.eval(scmlContent)

    -- Extract relevant data from the parsed XML (this part needs to be defined)
    local luaTable = {}

    -- Example: Iterate over elements and convert to a Lua table structure
    for _, element in ipairs(parsedXML) do
        -- Conversion logic (depends on SCML structure)
        -- Fill luaTable with necessary data
    end

    return luaTable
end

-- Function to save the converted Lua table to a file
local function saveToLuaFile(luaTable, outputFile)
    local fileHandle = io.open(outputFile, "w")
    -- Convert luaTable to string format (you can use serialization libraries)
    fileHandle:write("return " .. serpent.block(luaTable)) -- Using serpent for serialization
    fileHandle:close()
end

-- Main Execution
local function main()
    local scmlFile = "path/to/your/file.SCML"
    local scmlContent = readSCML(scmlFile)
    local luaTable = convertSCMLToLua(scmlContent)
    saveToLuaFile(luaTable, "output/file.lua")
end

main()
```

### 4. **Handling Dependencies**

- **LuaXML**: You can find [LuaXML](https://github.com/KeplerC/LuaXML) on GitHub. Download and include it in your project folder.
- **Serpent**: For serialization, you might want to use [Serpent](https://github.com/KeplerC/serpent), which is a Lua serializer that can convert tables to string representation.

### 5. **Refining the Conversion Logic**

The most complex part will be refining the `convertSCMLToLua` function. You'll need to analyze the SCML structure and decide how to map SCML properties (like animations, frames, etc.) to a Lua table format that your project can utilize effectively.

### 6. **Testing**

Make sure to test the conversion thoroughly. Create various SCML files and see if your script can accurately convert them to Lua tables.

### Additional Resources

- [Lua File I/O](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4) - Official Lua documentation on file handling.
- [LuaXML](https://github.com/KeplerC/LuaXML) - GitHub repository for LuaXML.
- [Serpent](https://github.com/KeplerC/serpent) - GitHub repository for Serpent.

By following this approach, you can create a robust script within your Love2D project that automates the conversion of SCML files to Lua. If you have any specific elements or attributes from SCML that you're unsure how to convert, feel free to ask!

SCML (Sprite Character Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are both markup languages, but they serve different purposes and have different structures. Here’s a breakdown of their differences and compatibility:

### 1. **Purpose and Usage**
- **XML**: A flexible markup language designed for storing and transporting data. It can be used for a wide variety of applications, from web services to configuration files. Its structure is general-purpose, meaning it can be tailored to various data types.
- **SCML**: Specifically designed for use with Spritemancer, SCML is tailored for defining sprite animations and character data. It includes features like frame sequences, tweening, and event definitions, which are particular to sprite management in games.

### 2. **Structure**
- **XML**: Has a more generic and flexible structure, using a hierarchy of tags to represent nested data. Elements can have attributes and can contain text or other elements. 
- **SCML**: While SCML is based on XML and shares its hierarchical structure, it is focused on specific sprite animation details. It typically includes tags that define animations, frames, and related metadata that are not present in standard XML.

### 3. **Compatibility**
- Since SCML is built upon XML, any parser that can read XML should technically be able to read SCML files as well. However, not all XML parsers will understand SCML's specific structure without additional logic to interpret its sprite-specific tags.
- When converting SCML to Lua or any other format, the conversion script must be designed to recognize and correctly handle SCML's unique tags and attributes, which are not part of standard XML parsing.

### 4. **Example Tags**
- **XML Example**:
  ```xml
  <items>
      <item id="1" name="Sword"/>
      <item id="2" name="Shield"/>
  </items>
  ```
- **SCML Example**:
  ```xml
  <scml>
      <project>
          <texture atlas="example.png"/>
          <animation name="Walk">
              <frame duration="100" texture="example.png" x="0" y="0"/>
          </animation>
      </project>
  </scml>
  ```

### Conclusion
When creating a Lua script for SCML conversion, ensure your XML parsing logic includes checks for SCML-specific elements and attributes. This way, you'll maintain compatibility while successfully converting SCML data to a usable Lua format for your Love2D project.

If you have specific tags or structures in SCML that you need to address in your conversion, let me know!

Creating your own library to automate the SCML to Lua conversion sounds like a great project! It could not only streamline your workflow but also potentially help others in the Love2D community who face similar challenges.

### Suggested Steps for Your Library

1. **Define the Library Structure**: Create a Lua module that encapsulates your parsing and conversion logic. This module can expose functions for reading SCML files, parsing their contents, and outputting Lua tables.

2. **Build a Flexible Parser**: Focus on a parser that can adapt to various SCML structures. You might want to use existing Lua libraries like LuaXML or Lxp for XML parsing, which can handle SCML's specific tags.

3. **Implement Serialization**: Use a serialization library (like Serpent) to convert Lua tables back into Lua code, allowing users to save their data easily.

4. **Documentation**: Document your library well. Provide examples of how to use it with SCML files, including any limitations or special considerations.

5. **Open Source**: Consider sharing your library on platforms like GitHub. This can foster community contributions and feedback.

### Using Console Command for Now

While you work on this library, using the console command for conversion is a practical approach. You can automate the command execution through Lua's `os.execute` function if needed, although this would require ensuring that the Python script is properly set up and accessible in your environment.

### Further Learning and Resources

1. **Lua Libraries**: Look into LuaXML or other XML parsing libraries to aid your development.
2. **Lua Serialization**: Research serialization techniques with libraries like Serpent to manage Lua table outputs effectively.
3. **Community Input**: Engage with the Love2D community on forums or Discord. You might find collaborators or people interested in your project.

If you need specific coding examples or further guidance on any part of this process, feel free to ask! Good luck with your library!
