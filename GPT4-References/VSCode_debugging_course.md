### **Module 1: Getting Started with Debugging in VS Code**

#### **1.1 Installing VS Code and Debugging Extensions**

##### **Objective**
The goal of this section is to make sure you have VS Code properly set up for debugging your projects, whether you're using Lua (for Love2D) or another language.

##### **Steps**

1. **Install VS Code**  
   If you haven't installed VS Code yet, you can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a lightweight but powerful code editor that supports a wide variety of programming languages.
   
2. **Install Extensions for Debugging**  
   Depending on the language you plan to use for debugging, you’ll need to install the corresponding extension.

   - **For Lua (Love2D)**:
     - Install the **Lua Debugger** by searching for "Lua Debug" in the Extensions Marketplace in VS Code.
     - You may also want to install the **Love2D** extension for additional support if you're working with it.
   - **For Python**: Install the **Python** extension by Microsoft.
   - **For JavaScript/Node.js**: No need to install anything extra—VS Code has built-in support.
   
3. **Familiarize Yourself with the Debug Panel**  
   - Open VS Code and find the **Debugging** view by clicking on the left sidebar’s bug icon or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + D`. This will show you the Debugger panel, where you can manage breakpoints, see variables, and control the flow of your program.

4. **Testing the Debugger Setup**  
   To ensure that everything is working correctly:
   - Create a simple script in your chosen language (Lua, Python, JavaScript, etc.).
   - Add a line of code that outputs something (e.g., `print("Hello, Debugger!")` for Lua).
   - Open the **Run and Debug** tab in the Debugger view and try launching your program.

##### **Activity**  
1. **Install the necessary extensions for your preferred language**.
   - If you're working with Lua/Love2D, install "Lua Debugger" and test a small Love2D script.
   - If you're using Python or another language, install the corresponding debugger extension.

2. **Set up a basic project**:
   - Create a simple project in your chosen language (could be a Lua Love2D project).
   - Test if your code runs using the built-in terminal or run functionality.

---

#### **1.2 Configuring the Debugger (launch.json)**

##### **Objective**
Now that you have the environment set up, it's time to configure the debugger to work with your project using the `launch.json` file. This file tells VS Code how to run and debug your program.

##### **Steps**

1. **Creating the `launch.json` File**
   - Go to the **Run and Debug** tab and click on "create a `launch.json` file" if it's not already present.
   - Select the environment that matches your project (e.g., Love2D, Python, Node.js).
   
   For example:
   - **Lua/Love2D configuration**:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Love2D Debug",
           "type": "lua",
           "request": "launch",
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.lua",
           "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
           "stopOnEntry": true
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Python example**:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Python: Current File",
           "type": "python",
           "request": "launch",
           "program": "${file}",
           "console": "integratedTerminal"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Understanding Key Fields in `launch.json`**
   - **`name`**: A name you assign to this debug configuration.
   - **`type`**: The type of language you're debugging (e.g., `lua`, `python`).
   - **`program`**: The entry point of your program (e.g., the `main.lua` file in Love2D).
   - **`cwd`**: The current working directory, usually the folder of your project.
   - **`stopOnEntry`**: Set to `true` if you want the debugger to pause as soon as your program starts.

3. **Running and Testing Your Debugger Configuration**
   - Once your `launch.json` is set up, click the green play button in the Debug panel to run the debugger.
   - VS Code should launch the program and stop at the first line if `stopOnEntry` is true, or run the program normally if not.
   - You can set a breakpoint and re-run the program to test the debugger functionality (more on breakpoints in Module 2).

##### **Activity**  
1. **Set up the `launch.json` file** for your project, following the examples above.
   - If you are working with a Love2D project, make sure you point to your `main.lua` file.
   - Test that your debugger launches correctly.

2. **Run your code using the debugger**.
   - Ensure that your program runs, and the debugger starts as expected.

### **Module 2: Breakpoints and Step-by-Step Debugging**

#### **2.1 Setting and Managing Breakpoints**

##### **Objective**
In this section, you’ll learn how to set breakpoints, which are markers that tell the debugger to pause the execution of your code at a specific line. This allows you to inspect the program's state, examine variables, and determine if the flow of your program matches your expectations.

##### **Steps**

1. **Setting a Breakpoint**  
   - Open your code in VS Code.
   - To set a breakpoint, click to the left of the line number where you want the program to pause. A red dot will appear, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
   - Alternatively, you can press `F9` when your cursor is on a line of code to toggle a breakpoint.

2. **Running the Program**  
   - With a breakpoint set, start the debugger using the play button in the **Run and Debug** panel.
   - The program will run until it hits the breakpoint, then pause, allowing you to inspect variables and the state of the program.

3. **Conditional Breakpoints**  
   - Sometimes, you only want the program to pause when certain conditions are met. For example, you might want to break only when a variable reaches a certain value.
   - To set a conditional breakpoint, right-click on an existing breakpoint and choose **Edit Breakpoint**. You can now enter an expression that will pause the execution only if the condition evaluates to `true`.
   - Example: You can set the condition `x == 10` to pause only when the variable `x` equals 10.

4. **Logpoints (Optional)**  
   - Logpoints are like breakpoints, but instead of pausing the execution, they print messages to the Debug Console.
   - To set a logpoint, right-click in the gutter (left of line numbers), choose **Add Logpoint**, and specify the message you want to log.
   - Example: `The value of x is ${x}`.

##### **Activity**
1. Set breakpoints in your code at key locations, such as where important functions or events happen (e.g., `love.update` or `love.draw` in a Love2D game).
2. Test the breakpoints by running the debugger and observing when and where execution pauses.
3. Experiment with conditional breakpoints to see how they behave.

---

#### **2.2 Stepping Through Code**

##### **Objective**
Once the debugger pauses at a breakpoint, you can step through your code line by line to see exactly how it executes.

##### **Key Debugging Controls in VS Code**

1. **Step Over (F10)**  
   - When you "step over" a line, the debugger will execute the current line but not enter any functions called within that line. This is useful if you're not interested in going inside every function.
   
2. **Step Into (F11)**  
   - If you "step into" a line of code, the debugger will pause inside any function that is called on that line, allowing you to see what happens inside that function.
   
3. **Step Out (Shift+F11)**  
   - If you're inside a function and want to quickly exit back to the calling function, you can "step out". The debugger will execute the rest of the current function and pause when returning to the caller.
   
4. **Continue (F5)**  
   - This will resume the program execution until the next breakpoint is hit, or the program completes.

##### **Steps**

1. **Stepping Over Code**
   - After your code hits a breakpoint, press `F10` (Step Over) to move to the next line of code. Watch how the program progresses.

2. **Stepping Into Functions**
   - When you encounter a line that calls a function, press `F11` (Step Into) to enter that function and debug it line by line.

3. **Stepping Out of a Function**
   - If you're deep into a function and want to return to the previous context, press `Shift+F11` (Step Out).

4. **Continue Execution**
   - After inspecting the code, you can press `F5` to continue the program's execution until the next breakpoint.

##### **Activity**
1. Set a few breakpoints in your code.
2. Practice stepping over (`F10`), stepping into (`F11`), and stepping out (`Shift+F11`) of functions.
3. Test how the program behaves when you continue execution (`F5`).

---

### **Summary**
- **Breakpoints** are crucial for stopping the execution at important spots in your program.
- **Stepping over** lets you move line by line without diving into functions.
- **Stepping into** allows you to explore the inner workings of a function call.
- **Stepping out** takes you back to the calling function, useful when you’re done debugging a particular function.

### **Module 3: Inspecting Variables and Expressions**

#### **3.1 Viewing Variables in the Debugger**

##### **Objective**
When your program pauses at a breakpoint, you'll often want to inspect the values of variables to see if they contain the expected data. VS Code provides an easy way to view variables in real-time during debugging.

##### **Steps**

1. **Add a Breakpoint**  
   - Set a breakpoint in your code where you want to pause and inspect variables (e.g., in the `love.update` or `love.draw` functions in Love2D).
   
2. **Launch the Debugger**  
   - Run the program with the debugger (`F5`) and let it hit the breakpoint.

3. **Open the Variables Panel**  
   - Once your program pauses, the **Variables** panel in the Debugger view (on the left side) will show a list of all the variables that are currently in scope. This includes:
     - **Local variables**: Variables local to the function where the breakpoint is.
     - **Global variables**: Any globally accessible variables.
     - **Watched variables** (optional, discussed later).

4. **Inspect Values**  
   - Expand the variables to inspect their values. You can see details such as numbers, strings, tables (in Lua), and more.
   - In Lua, for example, you can inspect tables (like `player`, `enemy`, etc.) and their nested fields directly from the panel.

##### **Activity**
1. Set breakpoints in your code.
2. Use the Variables panel to inspect the values of different variables when the breakpoint is hit.
3. Experiment with examining local and global variables.

---

#### **3.2 Adding Watch Expressions**

##### **Objective**
Watch expressions allow you to track specific variables or expressions without having to pause at a breakpoint. You can monitor how a variable changes as the program runs.

##### **Steps**

1. **Open the Watch Panel**  
   - In the **Run and Debug** view, you'll see a section labeled **WATCH**. This is where you can add variables or expressions you want to track.

2. **Add an Expression to Watch**  
   - Click the `+` icon in the Watch panel and enter the name of the variable or expression you want to monitor.
   - Example: If you want to watch the variable `player.x`, add `player.x` as a watch expression.

3. **View Changes Over Time**  
   - As your program runs, the debugger will continuously evaluate the watch expression and update its value in the panel.
   - You can also add complex expressions (e.g., `player.x + player.y`), and the debugger will evaluate them and show the result.

4. **Remove or Modify Watches**  
   - You can easily remove or edit a watch expression by right-clicking it and selecting **Remove** or **Edit**.

##### **Activity**
1. Add a few variables (or expressions) to the Watch panel and run your program.
2. Observe how the values update in real-time as the program executes.

---

#### **3.3 Hover to Inspect Variables**

##### **Objective**
VS Code provides a convenient feature where you can hover over variables in the editor during a debug session to see their values instantly.

##### **Steps**

1. **Run the Debugger and Pause Execution**  
   - Let your code hit a breakpoint as before.

2. **Hover Over Variables**  
   - In the code editor, move your mouse over any variable. A popup will display its current value.
   - For example, hover over `player.x` to see its value at that moment in execution.

3. **Inspect Complex Structures**  
   - If you hover over tables or objects (like a `player` table in Lua), you can expand the popup to view deeper levels of the structure (e.g., `player.position.x`, `player.health`).

##### **Activity**
1. Hover over various variables during a debug session to see their values.
2. Test this with both simple variables (like numbers or strings) and more complex structures (like tables).

---

#### **3.4 Using the Debug Console for Variable Inspection**

##### **Objective**
In addition to viewing variables through the Variables panel and Watch panel, you can manually evaluate expressions using the **Debug Console**.

##### **Steps**

1. **Open the Debug Console**  
   - The Debug Console is located at the bottom of VS Code (or press `Ctrl + Shift + Y` to open it).

2. **Evaluate Variables and Expressions**  
   - While the debugger is paused, you can type the name of any variable in the console and press **Enter** to see its current value.
   - You can also evaluate complex expressions directly.
     - Example: Type `player.x + 10` and press **Enter** to see the result.

3. **Run Code in the Console**  
   - You can run code snippets within the console to test things in real-time. For instance, you could modify a variable (`player.health = 100`) and see how it affects the program once you resume execution.

##### **Activity**
1. Pause the program at a breakpoint and open the Debug Console.
2. Test evaluating variables and expressions.
3. Try modifying a variable through the console and see its effect in your code.

---

### **Summary**

- The **Variables panel** provides an easy way to see all variables in scope when a breakpoint is hit.
- **Watch expressions** allow you to track specific variables or expressions continuously throughout the execution.
- You can **hover over variables** in the code editor to inspect their values quickly.
- The **Debug Console** lets you evaluate variables and run code on the fly, which is especially useful for testing or quick debugging.

### **Module 4: Advanced Debugging Techniques**

#### **4.1 Conditional Breakpoints**

##### **Objective**
Conditional breakpoints allow you to pause execution only when certain conditions are met, such as when a variable has a specific value or when a particular condition evaluates to `true`. This is useful when you only want to stop the program at certain states, rather than every time a breakpoint is hit.

##### **Steps**

1. **Set a Conditional Breakpoint**  
   - Right-click on the line where you want to add a breakpoint and choose **Add Conditional Breakpoint**.
   
2. **Specify the Condition**  
   - Enter the condition that should be met for the breakpoint to trigger.
   - Example: If you want to stop only when `player.health < 20`, type `player.health < 20` in the condition box.
   
3. **Run the Debugger**  
   - Start the debugger and let the program run. It will only pause at that breakpoint when the specified condition is `true`.

##### **Activity**
1. Set a conditional breakpoint in your game where you only want to pause when a character’s health drops below a certain threshold.
2. Run the debugger and observe how it pauses when the condition is met.

---

#### **4.2 Hit Count Breakpoints**

##### **Objective**
Hit count breakpoints allow you to pause execution after a breakpoint has been hit a specified number of times. This is useful when a certain loop or function is called many times, but you only want to pause after it has been hit a certain number of times.

##### **Steps**

1. **Add a Hit Count Breakpoint**  
   - Right-click on a breakpoint and choose **Edit Breakpoint**.
   - In the options, you’ll see a field for **Hit Count**. Enter the number of times the breakpoint must be hit before the debugger pauses.
   
2. **Run the Debugger**  
   - The debugger will ignore the breakpoint until it has been hit the specified number of times.

##### **Activity**
1. Set a hit count breakpoint inside a loop, and set the hit count to 5.
2. Run the program and observe how the breakpoint is only triggered after the loop has executed 5 times.

---

#### **4.3 Exception Breakpoints**

##### **Objective**
Sometimes, your program might throw an exception or error, and you want to immediately pause execution when that happens. Exception breakpoints allow you to break whenever an error occurs, so you can inspect the stack and variables right when the issue happens.

##### **Steps**

1. **Enable Exception Breakpoints**  
   - In the **Run and Debug** panel, click the gear icon (or the **...** menu) and choose **Add Exception Breakpoint**.
   - Choose whether you want the breakpoint to trigger on all exceptions or only on uncaught exceptions.
   
2. **Run the Debugger**  
   - When an exception is thrown in your code, the debugger will pause, and you can inspect what went wrong.

##### **Activity**
1. Introduce an intentional error in your code (like dividing by zero) and enable exception breakpoints.
2. Run the program and see how the debugger catches the exception.

---

#### **4.4 Modifying Variables Mid-Debug**

##### **Objective**
While debugging, you might want to change the value of a variable to see how it affects the program. You can modify variables on the fly during a debug session, which allows for more dynamic testing.

##### **Steps**

1. **Pause the Program**  
   - Hit a breakpoint to pause the program’s execution.

2. **Modify Variable in the Variables Panel or Debug Console**  
   - In the **Variables panel**, find the variable you want to change and double-click its value to modify it.
   - Alternatively, in the **Debug Console**, type a command to modify the variable.
     - Example: `player.health = 100`.
   
3. **Continue Execution**  
   - After changing the variable, press `F5` to continue execution and see how the modified value affects the program.

##### **Activity**
1. Run your game and pause it during execution.
2. Modify key variables (e.g., health, position) and observe the impact when you continue execution.

---

#### **4.5 Call Stack and Navigating Frames**

##### **Objective**
The **Call Stack** panel shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current breakpoint. You can navigate through the different frames in the stack to see how execution reached the current point.

##### **Steps**

1. **View the Call Stack**  
   - When a breakpoint is hit, the **Call Stack** panel will show the sequence of function calls (stack frames) leading to the current execution point.

2. **Inspect Each Frame**  
   - Click on any frame in the call stack to view the corresponding code in the editor. The Variables panel will update to show the variables in scope for that frame.
   
3. **Navigate Through the Call Stack**  
   - By navigating through the call stack, you can see how variables changed at different levels of the call sequence and better understand the flow of execution.

##### **Activity**
1. Set a breakpoint in a function that is called from multiple places.
2. When the program pauses, explore the call stack and inspect the variables in each frame.

---

#### **4.6 Debugging Coroutines (for Lua Users)**

##### **Objective**
Lua’s coroutines can complicate debugging due to their non-linear execution. This section will show how to handle debugging in coroutine-based workflows.

##### **Steps**

1. **Set Breakpoints Inside Coroutines**  
   - Set breakpoints as usual inside functions that are part of a coroutine.

2. **Step Through Coroutine Execution**  
   - Use the **Step Over** (`F10`) and **Step Into** (`F11`) commands to trace the flow of execution inside coroutines. When a coroutine is resumed or yielded, you can inspect its state just like a regular function.

##### **Activity**
1. Create a simple coroutine in your Lua code.
2. Set breakpoints and use stepping to debug the coroutine as it resumes and yields.

---

### **Summary**
- **Conditional Breakpoints**: Only pause execution when a condition is true.
- **Hit Count Breakpoints**: Pause after a breakpoint is hit a certain number of times.
- **Exception Breakpoints**: Automatically pause when an exception occurs.
- **Modifying Variables Mid-Debug**: Change the value of variables during debugging.
- **Call Stack Navigation**: Explore the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program.
- **Coroutine Debugging**: Step through coroutine execution to inspect states.

### **Module 5: Debugging Optimization and Performance**

#### **5.1 Efficient Debugging Practices**

##### **Objective**
Using efficient debugging practices can save time and make your debugging sessions more productive. Here are some techniques to optimize your workflow:

1. **Use Debugging Shortcuts**  
   Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts for common debugging actions:
   - **Continue**: `F5` (Run to the next breakpoint)
   - **Step Over**: `F10` (Execute the next line, skipping function calls)
   - **Step Into**: `F11` (Enter into the function calls)
   - **Step Out**: `Shift + F11` (Exit the current function)
   - **Restart Debugging**: `Ctrl + Shift + F5` (Restart the debugging session)
   
   These shortcuts can help you navigate your code more efficiently.

2. **Use Breakpoints Wisely**  
   - Set breakpoints strategically in areas where you suspect issues rather than setting them everywhere. This helps reduce the noise and allows you to focus on the problem.

3. **Leverage Conditional Breakpoints**  
   Use conditional breakpoints to pause execution only when certain criteria are met. This is especially useful in loops or functions that run multiple times.

4. **Utilize Watch Expressions**  
   Use the **Watch** panel to monitor specific variables or expressions. This allows you to see how values change over time without having to stop at multiple breakpoints.

##### **Activity**
- Practice using debugging shortcuts in your next debugging session.
- Set conditional breakpoints in a loop to see how the variable values change.

---

#### **5.2 Performance Profiling**

##### **Objective**
Profiling helps identify performance bottlenecks in your code. Here are some techniques to profile and optimize performance:

1. **Use Love2D’s Built-in Profiler**  
   Love2D has built-in profiling tools that can be enabled to track frame time and identify what takes the most time during updates and rendering.

   Add the following code to enable profiling:
   ```lua
   function love.update(dt)
       local start = love.timer.getTime()
       -- Your update logic here
       local elapsed = love.timer.getTime() - start
       print("Update took: " .. elapsed .. " seconds")
   end
   ```

   This will log how long your `update` function takes to execute.

2. **Use Lua Profiling Libraries**  
   Consider using Lua profiling libraries such as **LuaProfiler** or **Profiler** to gain deeper insights into your code's performance. These libraries can provide detailed reports on function calls and their execution time.

3. **Optimize Your Code**  
   - Identify slow loops and algorithms. Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms.
   - Minimize the number of calls to expensive operations (e.g., frequent table lookups, string manipulations).
   - Cache values when possible to avoid redundant calculations.

##### **Activity**
- Implement the built-in profiler in your game and analyze the output to find potential bottlenecks.
- Try optimizing a slow function based on your profiling results.

#### **5.3 Debugging Memory Usage**

##### **Objective**
Memory leaks and excessive memory usage can affect your game’s performance. Debugging memory usage can help you identify and fix these issues.

1. **Monitor Memory Usage**  
   Use Love2D’s built-in memory functions to check memory usage:
   ```lua
   print(love.graphics.getStats().texturememory) -- Memory used by textures
   print(collectgarbage("count")) -- Memory used by Lua in KB
   ```

   This can help you identify when memory usage spikes and track down leaks.

2. **Use the Garbage Collector**  
   Lua has automatic garbage collection, but you can manually trigger it to see if memory usage decreases:
   ```lua
   collectgarbage() -- Trigger garbage collection
   ```

3. **Identify and Fix Memory Leaks**  
   - Look for tables that are not being cleared when they are no longer needed.
   - Ensure event listeners and other callbacks are properly removed to avoid holding references.

##### **Activity**
- Monitor your game’s memory usage during runtime and analyze the output.
- Use the garbage collector to clean up unused memory and observe changes.

#### **5.4 Final Tips for Debugging**

1. **Keep Your Code Clean**  
   Clean and organized code is easier to debug. Follow good coding practices like consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and modular design.

2. **Document Your Debugging Process**  
   Keep notes on what issues you encountered, how you resolved them, and what tools you used. This can help streamline your debugging process in future projects.

3. **Practice Debugging Regularly**  
   The more you practice debugging, the more efficient you will become. Regularly challenge yourself to find and fix bugs in your projects.

4. **Use Version Control**  
   Use a version control system (like Git) to manage your code. This allows you to revert changes if a debugging session goes wrong and helps track the history of your code.
